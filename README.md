The examiner Prof. Dr. Hesham Ali is Prof. Hesham El_Rewini as can be checked in his recomendation letter, he was a Prof. (maybe departement chairman if I remember correctly)at SMU Southern Methodist University at that time. 

The thing is Computer Departement at Faculty of Engineering Alexandria University is the first ever founded in the middle east at 1969 (execluding Israel), and they were very cautious in giving PhD degrees without foreign interaction proof to be equivelant and comparable to international ranked universities.

So, they required:
1- more than > 80% score in the GRE subjective in Computer Science
2- Publishing a number of papers in international journals and conferences that review based on full paper not just abstract
3-A foreigner examiner (I send the full thesis by official regular mail and submit the receipt to the departement, then only when the examiner reply to the departement by a signed report qualifying the thesis to be submitted after at least 1 month reading, only then they go on with the formal procedure of setting a debate date and so on)


Also, My master thesis link by the way
