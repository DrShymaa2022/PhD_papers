This folder contains the reference archives I find to my PhD papers ( debated 2001, a very long time ago)

the 2 papers are from rutgers DIMACS archive, and PhD_3607 is the whole PhD as from the university library

The PhD itself is from Faculty of Engineering Alexandria University " */ Operating on Optimal Binary Code Trees /* "

(Of course the */ Operating Systems /* topic is */a mistake /* due to the word, the thesis belongs to */ Algorithms Design & Analysis /* and */ Data Structures /* )

(although I once participated in supervising a master thesis about OS Scheduling later on 2007, http://www.eulc.edu.eg/eulc_v5/Libraries/Thesis/BrowseThesisPages.aspx?fn=PublicDrawThesis&BibID=9581512)


Back to my PhD, the examiner Prof. Dr. Hesham Ali is Prof. Hesham El_Rewini as can be checked in his recomendation letter, he was a Prof. (maybe departement chairman if I remember correctly)at SMU Southern Methodist University at that time. 

The thing is Computer Departement at Faculty of Engineering Alexandria University is the first ever founded in the middle east at 1969 (execluding Israel), and they were very cautious in giving PhD degrees without foreign interaction proof to be equivelant and comparable to international ranked universities.

So, they required:
1- more than > 80% score in the GRE subjective in Computer Science
2- Publishing a number of papers in international journals and conferences that review based on full paper not just abstract
3-A foreigner examiner (I send the full thesis by official regular mail and submit the receipt to the departement, then only when the examiner reply to the departement by a signed report qualifying the thesis to be submitted after at least 1 month reading, only then they go on with the formal procedure of officially informing the faculty to set a debate date and so on)

A recent citation to one of the PhD papers, April 2025, appeared this year as reference [14] in (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-82014-4_7) and I c've contacted the authors with more details and the rest of related papers. Reference [10] too is another paper of mine.

Also, My master thesis link by the way  */* An Efficient Parallel Sample Sorting */*
